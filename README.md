# Ecommerce project is my another portfolio project in a Data science course on Udemy. In this project, i trained a model that helps an ecommerce company to focus on Mobile App or Company Website. Here, i used a Linear Regression. Following is my answer to the question:


In general, if we assume these coefficients represent the weights from a regression model, a higher coefficient value indicates a stronger positive relationship between the feature and the target variable. Comparing the coefficients for "Time on App" and "Time on Website," we see that the "Time on App" coefficient (38.590159) is significantly higher than the "Time on Website" coefficient (0.190405). This suggests that the time spent on the mobile app has a stronger positive impact on the target variable (which is not provided) compared to the time spent on the website.

However, without additional information about the target variable, the specific goals of the company, and the context of the analysis, it is difficult to make a conclusive recommendation. Factors such as user behavior, target audience, business objectives, and industry trends should also be considered when deciding where to allocate resources.

It's generally a good practice for companies to prioritize mobile app development, considering the increasing popularity of mobile devices and the convenience they offer to users. However, this decision ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the company. Conducting further analysis, gathering more data, and considering other relevant factors would be beneficial in making an informed decision.
